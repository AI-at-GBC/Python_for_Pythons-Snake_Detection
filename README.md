# Deep Learning 2-Snake Project
As a prototype for the AI logic behind a mobile application that can be used to detect different types of snakes, we trained different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models from the [Tensorflow 2 Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) in an effort to benchmark different methods, build a model that works for our purposes, and of course, to learn.

## Setup Instructions
Download the Pre-processed Snake Images dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameeharahman/preprocessed-snake-images), and follow the instructions on [training a custom object detector with Tensorflow 2](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html). We have provided annotations in XML format for a number of images from the dataset (500 from the training set, 100 from the testing set) which can be found in the annotations/ directory.
